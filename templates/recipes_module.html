	<p>This is really similar to the <em>What can I make</em> section.  You can filter down the boxes, and combine your filters with 
	logical operators, courtesy of <a href="https://github.io/altef/logipar">Logipar</a>.  Unfortunately, they read awkwardly here.</p>  
	<p>I'm not sure about how I want this section to work in general.  
	It may not be overly useful as more than a toy.  We'll see.  If you have any requests, let me know.</p>
	<p>Like the <em>What can I make</em> tab, you can do:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Foodtype is veggie</strong> to see all the vegetarian options.  The other values seem to be "meat", "goodies", and empty.  You use this option with any of the fields, which are:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Foodtype</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Sanity</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Hunger</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Health</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Perishtime</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Cooktime</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Temperature</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Temperatureduration</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Priority</strong> &ndash; if your ingredients match more than one test function, presumably the one with the highest priority will be selected.</li>
				<li><strong>Name</strong></li>
				<li><strong>TestM</strong> &ndash; the test function to see if this recipe can be generated from your ingredients.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Less than [amount] [field]</strong>, <strong>[amount field]</strong>, <strong>Greater than [amount field]</strong> can be used with any numeric field: 
		Sanity, Hunger, Health, Perishtime, Cooktime, Temperature, Temperatureduration, Priority.  The same aliases also apply (<strong>fewer than</strong> and <strong>more than</strong>).</li>
		<li><strong>Name contains meat</strong> will show all recipes that have "meat" in their name.</li>
